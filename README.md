The focus of this project is salary prediction. The data set includes information on job descriptions and salaries. The aim is to use the data set to predict the salary of a job posting based on the job description using Text Mining. This is important, because this model can make a salary recommendation as soon as a job description is entered into a system. I have used techniques such as TF-IDF Vectorizer, Latent Semantic Analysis (Singular Value Decomposition) to handle text data. I have used models such as Decision Tree, Voting Regressor, ADABoost and Multilayer Perceptron Regressor to predict the salary. Voting Regressor turned out to be the best performing model!
